Requirements:

  1) a working server with at least PHP 4.2.2 (the newer the better!), 
     and sessions enabled (configured properly) if you want to use
     user authentication

  2) a HTML 4 compliant browser (it works even with 
     lynx 2.8.3dev.9 (13 Sep 1999!)), though it's not too comfortable
     to select tons of files without the help of javascript

Installation:

  The installation process is really easy (however, you can 
  heavily finetune FSGuide to your needs).
  For the impatient/experienced:

  1) unzip the file into some web-accessible directory
  2) move config/user.ini-dist
     to a safe place outside document root (!!!)
  3) configure FSGuide:
        config/config.inc.php,
        /some/safe_place/user.ini
  4) add users if you want, or specify settings for the default
     user in /some/safe_place/user.ini
  5) disable access to the directory /some/safe_place/ in
     /some/safe_place/user.ini              

  However, I recommend reading the detailed installation instructions.

Installation: detailed instructions

  1) extract the archive into a subdirectory somewhere under your
     document root (eg. /var/www/fsguide)

  2) IMPORTANT:    
     move config/user.ini-dist to a safe place - outside the
     document root!
     If you skip this step, users can simply download this file and
     gain access to any directories/FSGuide passwords!

  3) open the config file:
     config/config.inc.php

     a) set the the $default['USER_CONFIGFILE'] setting to the 
        path and filename where you've moved config/user.ini-dist

     b) decide:
        - do you want to require users to log in? If so, set 
            $default['USER_AUTHENTICATION'] = true;

        - if it's enough for you to access FSGuide (and
          your filesystem) without logging in, set 
            $default['USER_AUTHENTICATION'] = false;

  4) now open the user.ini file

     a) if you'll use FSGuide without logins/passwords,
        specify settings for the [default] user.

     b) if you want to use user authentication (recommended),
        add a new user (or more users), and specify the details
        (access rules, etc.).

  5) finetune directory access:
     - you MUST disable access to the directory where you've moved
       user.ini to. you'll find examples 
     - you may want to disable all access to the root 
       directories (recommended)
     - now enable directories you'd like to offer for the user
       (and may specify start directories and so on)

     See 
       - user.ini-explained and 
       - user.ini-full 
     for examples and explanation of settings.

  6) now you can open the FSGuide in your browser. 
     if user auth is set, the login screen will appear first.
