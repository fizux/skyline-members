FSGuide is a Norton Commander-clone for the web, which might be useful
when you do not have shell access to your server, but want to
perform basic file operations. 

Ofcourse you can reach every file of the filesystem
the web user (www-data or wwwrun used by Apache) has the
privileges for (and not just files and directories under htdocs and 
the like).
This way you can display, copy, remove any file or subdirectory.

FSGuide features:
- user authentication (you can disable user authentication to use 
  FSGuide without logging in)
- details of user access are configurable in a simple .ini file
- deeply customizable through its configuration file and
  the user.ini file, loads of peruser settings
- access control finetuning through access control lists in user ini file
- you can implement your own authentication module (eg. rdbms-based)
- two-panel display (supports sorting)
- directory bookmarks
- selecting files using checkboxes
  You can even "cross-copy" files between the two panels:
  after selecting files in both panels, just click the copy or move
  button - this way all the selected files are copied/moved to the
  other panel. If you click on the delete button, all the selected
  files in both panels are deleted.
- advanced file selection dialog (select files by
  regular expression, extension, extension group, permission, filesize, time)
- copying, moving, deleting files and directories even recursively
- renaming files or directories (only the first selected file)
- creating directories 
- the file operations use no external commands (it helps multiplatform use)
- a one-line navigator on both panels. Clicking on parts
  of the navigator results in opening that subdirectory in the
  panel.
- downloading files (and optional bandwidth control mechanism)
- opening and displaying files:
  - built-in detection for different filetypes 
    (DOC, PDF, text, PHP, binary, etc.) by extension or contents
  - displaying files depending on the result of the detection:
    - files having .php and .inc extension are displayed
      using source highlight
    - images files recognized by PHP are displayed as images:
      this helps a lot while organizing image files on a remote
      server (eg. if you use Windows).
    - If there are no other special characters than
      #09 (tab), #10 (CR), #12 (page break), #13 (LF), the file is displayed
      as a simple textfile. The file is divided into 10000 characters
      long pages (you can use the "more" or "less" links to
      switch between pages)
    - If there are other special characters in the file,
      or characters undefined in the ISO-8859-2 codepage, then the
      file is treated as a binary file. In this case the control
      characters, and ISO-8859-2's undefined characters (0x7f-
      0x9f) are replaced with a dot (to avoid browsers
      displaying contents erroneously and to conform the
      HTML standard).
- file uploader: 
    - configurable number of files to upload at once
    - you can configure any application to run after upload
    - you can check to drop the original file when the application finishes
- file editor:
    - plain text editor
    - binary editor
- works under both Windows and Linux
- does not depend on third-party libraries or extensions and needs no RDBMS
- produces well-formatted, valid HTML 4.01 Transitional pages
- uses PHP's error messages to report errors of file operations (since
  the default messages contain all the important information about
  the errors). This will change in the future.
