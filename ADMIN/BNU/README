About FSGuide
-------------

FSGuide is a Norton Commander-clone for the web, which might be useful
when you do not have shell access to your server, but want to
perform various file operations. As a hosting provider, you can even
give this tool to your hosting users, so they can access and modify
their files through FSGuide - or you can use it yourself
as a system administration tool.

Note: Due to the limitations of running scripts in server environment,
you can reach only those files of the filesystem that are
available to the web user (www-data or wwwrun used by Apache).
In general, it's much more than just the files and directories 
under document root!

FSGuide features:
- user authentication (you can disable user authentication to use 
  FSGuide without logging in)
- details of user access are configurable in a simple .ini file
- deeply customizable through its configuration file and
  the user.ini file, loads of peruser settings
- access control finetuning through access control lists in user ini file
- you can implement your own authentication module (eg. rdbms-based)
- two-panel display (supports sorting)
- directory bookmarks
- selecting files using checkboxes
  You can even "cross-copy" files between the two panels:
  after selecting files in both panels, just click the copy or move
  button - this way all the selected files are copied/moved to the
  other panel. If you click on the delete button, all the selected
  files in both panels are deleted.
- advanced file selection dialog (select files by
  regular expression, extension, extension group, permission, filesize, time)
- advanced rename tool (add/remove characters, case conversion, 
  regular expression rename)
- copying, moving, deleting files and directories even recursively
- renaming files or directories (only the first selected file)
- creating directories 
- the file operations use no external commands (it helps multiplatform use)
- a one-line navigator on both panels. Clicking on parts
  of the navigator results in opening that subdirectory in the
  panel.
- downloading files (and optional bandwidth control mechanism)
- opening and displaying files:
  - built-in detection for different filetypes 
    (DOC, PDF, text, PHP, binary, etc.) by extension or contents
  - displaying files depending on the result of the detection:
    - files having .php and .inc extension are displayed
      using source highlight
    - images files recognized by PHP are displayed as images:
      this helps a lot while organizing image files on a remote
      server (eg. if you use Windows).
    - If there are no other special characters than
      #09 (tab), #10 (CR), #12 (page break), #13 (LF), the file is displayed
      as a simple textfile. The file is divided into 10000 characters 
      (configurable) long pages (you can use the "more" or "less" links to
      switch between pages)
    - If there are other special characters in the file,
      or characters undefined in the current codepage (ISO-8859 family
      is supported), then the file is treated as a binary file. In this 
      case the control characters, and the undefined 
      characters (0x7f-0x9f) of the ISO-8859 codepage family are 
      replaced with a dot (to avoid browsers displaying contents erroneously 
      and to conform the HTML standard).
- file uploader: 
    - configurable number of files to upload at once
    - you can configure any application to run after upload
    - you can check to drop the original file when the application finishes
- file editor:
    - plain text editor
    - binary editor
- works under both Windows and Linux
- does not depend on third-party libraries or extensions and needs no RDBMS
- produces well-formatted, valid HTML 4.01 Transitional pages
- uses PHP's error messages to report errors of file operations (since
  the default messages contain all the important information about
  the errors). This will change in the future.
