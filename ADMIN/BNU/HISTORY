v0.7  // released on 2005-04-25
    + added Italian translation, thanks to Marco Ponti!
    + rename form now handles multiple files
    + added dialog to rename form - such powerful rename tool has
      never been before in a web-based file manager!
        - remove given characters from filename
        - remove N characters (from beginning/end/given position of filename)
        - add string (to beginning/end/given position of filename)
        - regular expression replace
    + added (fake) statusbar (left top corner, under "bottom" link).
      shows up when you click on select all/none/invert selection
      on hundreds (thousands) of files in a directory.
      also used for rename form (placed after the form legend).
    + added edit link for php viewer
    + i18n done/fixed for 
      - sort arrows, 
      - create/last access time (appears as tooltip 
        when mouse cursor is over panel timestamps)
      - select/unselect dialog extension group select 
        (reported by Marco Ponti)
    * fixed bug 919535: save_textfile() function saved extra \ characters 
      for files containing ' when magic_quotes_gpc was on

v0.6  // released on 2004-11-28
    * array_multisort bug fixed,
      https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1119844&forum_id=265340
    + added Spanish translation, thanks to Andres Barreto!
    + advanced file compare dialog
    * JavaScript confirmation before deleting files
    + donations accepted through Kagi

v0.5  // released on 2004-03-09
    (tons of important changes, maybe it should be more than 0.5 :)

    + download option with configurable bandwidth-control
      (browser-quirks identifier class was included from 
       the Horde framework)
    + user authentication and per-user settings through user.ini
      it's even possible to create your own user authentication module
      (eg. rdbms-based) by replacing user.ini.php with your own
    + session-based user authentication
    + you can still use FSGuide without login/password, in which case
      the [default] settings of user.ini will be used
    + per-user settings:
       - bookmarks= (shortcuts to frequently used directories)
       - start= (start directories)
       - dirN= (access control rules to define rights)
       - password= (user password)
       - and other settings from config.inc.php
    + you can override default settings in user.ini
    * reorganized directory structure
    * the Windows driveletter-shortcuts are removed. you can simulate
      nearly the same effect by using the bookmarks
    * the '.' (current directory) filename can be configured to be shown or
      not (now disabled by default)
    * fixed bug: couldn't access directories having ' or & in its name
      (reported by Ercolino, thanks for further suggestions too!)
    * navigatorline() reviewed (variable name changes only)

v0.42 // released on 2004-02-17
    * workaround for a kinda annoying bug of MSIE: it does not support 
      multiple submit <BUTTON>s sharing a common "name" and
      having different "value" attributes (anyways, it works fine under 
      also Opera, Mozilla) (reported by Ercolino)

v0.41 // released on 2004-02-10
    * large filelist resulted an Apache error due to large amount of
      GET data (now using POST method for the main form and the 
      REQUEST array everywhere in the code) (reported by Ronalds)
    * small HTML and image fixes
    + added rating, please do rate if you use and like it 

v0.4 // released on 2004-01-14
    + added 'check all', 'check none', 'invert selection' and 
      an advanced select dialog 
    + added file selector dialog (by filetype, extension, regexp, filesize)
    + filelist function added
    + language tool added - it helps translators to find missing 
      defines in language files (see includes/langtool.php).
    + added customized free icon sets from: 
        - Ben of hooboo.com (iconsets/ben),  
        - Barbara Kaemper's 'Landscapes' (iconsets/bk) 
        - Andi Peredri's 'QIcons 0.1' (iconsets/quicons), 
        - and the GNOME icon set 'Noia' (iconsets/noia)
    + added French language file (created by Ben Bois)
    + added German language file (created by Christopher Kramer)
    * <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON> was replaced with <BUTTON> to
      avoid problems with national characters in button names -
      now FSGuide needs HTML4 compliant browsers
    * fixed rename bug (reported by both Marton Elek and Christopher Kramer)
    - the 'check all' checkbox was missing in the root directory since
      it was positioned for the dot directory. Now it's eliminated by the
      new selection controls.
    * changed <? to <?php everywhere so settings of php.ini won't affect 
      fsguide
    * verified against HTML standard using W3C's validator

v0.3 // released on 2003-11-18

    + added html highlighter to viewer
    + added custom error handler
    + added file uploads with unzip option.

      + shows maximum upload filesize (php.ini setting) before upload
      + configurable number of upload controls
      + any command can be configured to run after upload 
        (unzip, mogrify, etc.)
    + javascript used for making the gui convenient (global invert checkbox)
    + text editor now saves the file
    + binary editor now saves the file
    + save_binaryfile() validates input values before updating the file
    * binary editor bugfix (last line did not appear)

    + added HISTORY, README, TODO files
    + localization support (English, Hungarian language files included)
    + skeleton for text and binary editing (does not store yet)
    + configuration file
    + support $default variable containing default values
      will be configurable later
    + filetype icons (taken from Apache) 
    + panel content sorting 
    + opening current directory 
    + drive selector under Windows

    + CSS layout
    * panel rendering rewritten to support sorting
    * replaced short variable- and functionnames 
    * viewer: now easy to add new filetypes
    * viewer: separate filetype determination and file viewer parts
    * viewer: file viewer parts are placed in an include file
    + viewer: added Content-type headers for PDF, RTF, PS,
