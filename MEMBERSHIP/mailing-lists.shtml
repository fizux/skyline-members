<h1>Club Mailing Lists</h1>
<h3>members@skylinesoaring.org</h3>
<ul>
[<a href = "http://members.skylinesoaring.org/MEMBERSHIP/mail-list.php#members@skylinesoaring.org">View People who read &quot;Members&quot;</a>]
<p>This mailing list is the life-blood of the flying club's latest news. All active members are automatically subscribed to this mailing list, with the exception of those members who can not stand the constant chatter any longer and beg for a reprieve from the webmasters (usually written on the back of a $50.00 bill.)</p>

<p>Currently, there are no members who have such an exemption.  The reason for this is because the content posted to this mailing list is pretty well contained. Here are the general rules of thumb for the members mailing list. 

<p>If you are replying to a message already sent to the members list, think one last time, before hitting send: &quot;Does every member in the club really need to see what I have to say in this message&quot;

<h4><b>DO</B> write to the members list about: </h4>
<ul><li>DO reports, 
<li>Announcements about new events coming up. 
<li>Announcements about happenings in the soaring community that all members will appreciate. 
<li>Concerns about safety, 
<li>Ideas for how we can improve
</uL>
<h4><b>DO NOT</b> write to the members list about: </h4>
<ul><li>Anything <b>NOT</b> soaring and <b>NOT</b> aviation related. 
<li>&quot;Me too!&quot;
<li>The latest dirty joke that your office is being passed around. That's what the MISC list is for.
<li>A message with an attachment, or multiple attachments that make the email big enough for the dial-up users to complain about
<li>Eschew hackneyed banalities -- i.e., notes of condolence for members whose favorite cat has recently died
<li>Anything particularly crude that would offend anybody on the list. Use your judgement here, people. 
<li>Something annoying enough to make valuable members on the list think &quot;Gee, I think I'm going to ask the webmasters to take me off of this members list. It's just too much chatter!&quot;
</ul>
</uL>

<h3>misc@skylinesoaring.org</h3>
<ul>
<p>Early in the club's email history, we decided that it would be absolutely necessary to bifurcate membership-related news from the odd goofy stuff that soaring pilots like to share.  Thus, the "misc" list was created.  E-mail has never been the same since then. 

<h4><b>DO</b> send to the misc list:</h4>
<ul>
<li>That great dirty joke you just got at the office
<li>That great movie about soaring that has something crazy on it
<li>That great picture of a plane that just crashed that you just have to share
<li>The URL to a website which has pictures of engineering or man-made disasters (we love those)
<li>Something that makes fun of the President
<li>Something that makes fun of the people who make fun at the President. 
<li>The URL to that tacky website you saw which has a tacky Christmas greeting.
</ul>

<h4><b>DO NOT</b> send to the misc list:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Something that all of the members should see; i.e. <i>Don't go out tomorrow! The tow plane is broken!</i>
<li>Something illegal that will make the webmasters be legally obligated to call the police on you
<li>Unsolicited advertising, such as Spam. Oooh I hates spam.  
</ul>


<p><i>Other information:</i>
<ul><li><a href="http://members.skylinesoaring.org/LIST-ARCHIVES/misc/">Archives</a> (Available to Skyline club members, even those who don't subscribe).
<li> Subscription to the misc list is open to non-members, and ex-members, too. The Skyline webmasters do not directly maintain this list.  To subscribe, go to <a href = " http://skylinesoaring.org/mailman/listinfo/misc/"> http://skylinesoaring.org/mailman/listinfo/misc/</a>, or write a note to <a href = "mailto:misc-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org">misc-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org</a>
<li>No complaints.  If you don't like the content, don't subscribe. (You can peek at the archives to get an idea before subscribing). 
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Weekdays@skylinesoaring.org</h3>
<ul>
<p>This list contains announcements and notes about operations on weekdays.  This list is just like the members, but whose audience is limited to a voluntary sign-up basis. This mostly includes people who have been known to take a day off on weekdays to go flying. Members who wish to be on the weekdays mailing list must sign themselves sign up.  To subscribe to this list, either: 
<ul>
<li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:weekdays-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org">weekdays-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org</a>, or 
<li>go to <a href="http://skylinesoaring.org/mailman/weekdays">http://skylinesoaring.org/mailman/weekdays</a>. 
</ul>

<p> You may view the weekdays archive by going to this URL.  [<a href="http://members.skylinesoaring.org/LIST-ARCHIVES/weekday/">Archives</a> ]  You do not need to be subscribed to the weekdays list to view the archives. </P>
</ul>

<h3>Husky@skylinesoaring.org</h3>
<ul>
<p> This list is designed for those who fly the Husky tow plane.  There may be a lot of overlap between the towpilots list and the Husky list, but there are people who fly the Husky who are not necessarily yet tow pilots.

<ul>
<li>Send an email to: <a href="mailto:husky-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org">husky-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org</a>, or
<li>go to <a href="http://skylinesoaring.org/mailman/husky">http://skylinesoaring.org/mailman/husky</a>. 
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Cirrus@skylinesoaring.org</h3>
<ul>
<p> This list is designed for those who have specific information that they want only to share with other Cirrus pilots. </p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email to: <a href="mailto:cirrus-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org">cirrus-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org</a>, or
<li>go to <a href="http://skylinesoaring.org/mailman/cirrus">http://skylinesoaring.org/mailman/cirrus</a>. 
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Winchers@skylinesoaring.org</h3>
<ul>
<p> This list is designed for those who have or want to share specific information about Winch Launching with others interested in Winching. </p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email to: <a href="mailto:winchers-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org">winchers-subscribe@skylinesoaring.org</a>, or
