| So! Give me the intel.  What kind of stuff did he ask you about, and
| what did you feel like you didn't know. I'm glad you got this out of
| the way before the year's end.

                                    
&lt;i&gt;                                            
Me too.  Here's the lowdown on the test:
                                                                                
I was supposed to meet Marvin at about 10:30, and not wanting to
be late I got there early.  Real early.  At least an hour early.  Marvin
wound up being almost an hour late, so that left me with the better
part of two hours to stew about what I might not know for the test.
I had forgotten my copy of the Glider Flying Handbook (it wasn't on
the checklist in the PTS, you see), so I couldn't actually do
anything about it, and I managed to convince myself that I was
doomed (DOOMED!) because I couldn't remember how to calculate
the K-Index. Eventually I decided to quiet my nerves by reviewing
the AIM section 7-6-4 on UFO reporting, just in case it cropped up
on the test. (It turns out it didn't.)
                                                                                
Marvin finally showed up, and we went over the pre-test briefing.
He informed me that we would not be covering any of the sections
of the PTS not required for someone with an ASEL getting an add-
on (The PTS itself states that he can cover these items if he
wishes, but I saw no need to call this to his attention.)  Most of the
omitted items were minor (e.g. cokpit management, radio
communications), but a few were surprising, like flight preparation
and planning, and the national airspace system.

At that point we took a break and then began the questioning.  I
wouldn't want to play poker with Marvin.  Every time I answered one
of his questions he would look at me as though I were the
stupidest person he'd ever examined.  Then he would mutter,
"That's correct."  The questions themselves covered pretty much
everything in the PTS, more or less in the order it appears in the
PTS.  He had asked me to get a weather briefing the night before,
so I was armed with my printout of the standard briefing I got off of
DUATS (5 pages of weather, 4376 pages of NOTAMS).  We talked
about each of the items in the briefing and what the significance
was for our operation, and also about why only DUATS or FSS is
an official briefing (because of the audit trail).  We also talked about
how the altimeter and variometer worked (but strangely, he omitted
the airspeed indicator), and we discussed assembly procedures,
but he didn't ask me to demonstrate.  That was about it for the
sitting-in-the-FBO part of the exam, but he continued to pose
questions throughout the remainder of the exam whenever he was
bored, or whenever it looked like I might be trying to concentrate.
                                                                                
Before we went out for the flight test he explained his philosophy
on performance standards, emphasizing that only consistently
exceeding tolerances was cause for failure; momentary lapses
were ok as long as they were promptly corrected.  Then he had a
smoke, and we went down to get the K-21.  He asked questions
throughout the preflight, but the only particularly unexpected one
was "Of the required aircraft documents, which one is the most
important?"  I had zero clue, but he didn't seem to mind.  His
opinion was that the registration is most important, since it is how
they find you to contact you if there is an AD for your plane.  Duly
noted.

When we went out for our first flight, I forgot to give him his
passenger briefing, and had to interrupt the launch to do it, which
was thoroughly embarrassing.  The takeoff went fine, and climb out
went something like this:
                                                                                
Me: We're passing 200 feet.
Marvin: What's that mean?
Me: We could turn back to the airfield if we had to.
Glider: *Pop*
Me: Well, it works sort of like this...
                                                                                
So, we rolled (most of the way) back to the end of 27 and hooked
up for another try.  He asked me to demonstrate boxing the wake,
so at 1500' AGL I called Eric and told him I was going to start.
Only, he didn't hear me.  So, just as I'm out on the corner he starts
to turn.  I wait for him to stabilize; he keeps turning.  Determined to
brazen it out; I go ahead with the maneuver.  Miraculously, I
completed the maneuver successfully, and we reach the top of the
tow.  We did some steep turns, and my first one kind of stank, but
the second one was pretty good.  Then some slow flight and turns
to a heading, the latter being strictly pro-forma, I think, since I don't
see how he could have measured the +/- 10 degree tolerance.  On
a heading that was plainly south (perpendicular to the runway) the
compass read 240.
                                                                                
Then he asked for some more slow flight.  I thought he was going
to ask me to do a stall, but we just kept cruising along.  Just when
I was about to ask him what he wanted to do, he barked, "What if
this happens?", grabbed the stick, and yanked backwards.  Geez,
man, all you had to do was ask.  By now we're down to about 2200
feet, near the IP for 27, and Marvin wants to go land on 9 so we
don't have to tow the glider back up the field.  With the wind out of
the southwest, no can do.  Marvin grumbles and wonders what I
would do if the wind were preventing me from landing on 27.  I
explain that in a pinch we could make an abbreviated pattern, or
even a left pattern onto 9, but I wasn't going to do it if 27 was
usable.  He grumbles some more but eventually assents.  We go
in high and do a slip to land.  No problemo.
                                                                                
On the last flight Marvin was particularly chatty.  Throughout the
tow he wanted to know about the "rules of the road" for ridge and
thermal soaring.  Suddenly, at about 2500 AGL the towplane waved
me off.  Just another little surprise Marvin had arranged for me.  At
that point he seemed to lose interest in the test and proceeded to
ask for the controls so he could demonstrate a few, uh,
"maneuvers".  Then we returned to land on 9 (Marvin apparently
really hates to tow the glider back up the field), and that was that.
We went inside to sign paperwork.  Reggie tried to bawl Marvin out
for not notifying Unicom that he was doing a rope break, to which
Marvin responded with his best "Who did you say you were again?"
stare, and I went out for a victory lap with Frank Banas as my first
passenger.  To be honest, I had envisioned my first passenger as
rather younger and, well, prettier than Frank, but you make do with
what you've got, I reckon.

Final note, Marvin is concerned about the legibility of my 8710-1,
so he's going to send me a typed one to sign, and he would like
you to sign it too, if possible.  Since I'm going to be out of town for
the rest of the month, starting Monday, I'm not sure exactly when
we might do that.  I'll let you know when I get the new form.
                                                                                
Thanks again for all your help over the past few months.
                                                                                
Regards,

<p>Checkride Notes </p><p>From: Sobieslaw Dziadek <br />Date: Sun, 12 Nov 2006 19:45:07 -0500<br />As some of you might already know, on Sunday 11/05/06 I&#39;ve finally took my checkride with Marvin. Here is a quick summary of things future student pilots should remember about: - Airworthiness Certificate - all that Bob Wander says in his book about it is that it does not expire. However it is not VALID if AD&#39;s are not implied. - Documents required when flying - from talking to other club members that recently had exam with Marvin it seems we all forget we need a photo ID besides PPL. - Bob Gould told me Marvin&#39;s distraction during his flight was that he &quot;would not shut up for more than 2 seconds&quot;. In my case it was the opposite - during the whole flight he said maybe 2 full sentences. I actually started getting worried I&#39;m doing something totally wrong. - Also after every maneuver Marv asked me to perform, he kept directing me towards east, almost all the way to Front Royal. He was waiting for me to take action and fly us back to the airfield. Besides this all the other questions were pretty much standard (Bob Wanders book). Everything went fine and he didn&#39;t have any comments regarding my knowledge or flying. I would like to thank all those involved in my re-licensing process, especially: Dave Dawood, Piet Barber and George Hazelrigg (with whom I&#39;ve spent numerous evenings studying for this exam). Thanks a lot - you have been a great source of information! See you at the field. Sobek</p>

<p>Checkride Notes </p><p>From: George &amp; Marti Ross &lt;ross3family_at_verizon.net&gt;<br /> Date: Wed, 7 Jul 2004 22:14:48 -0400<br /> <br /> Guys,<br /> Here&#39;s my commercial pilot license - glider checkride notes or Marvisms. Thanks a bunch to George Hazelrigg for the outstanding, two evening ground eval. I was more than prepared for the practical oral questions.<br /> <br /> First, call him Marvin not Marv. I specifically asked him and he said Marvin. Second, you couldn&#39;t ask for a more laid back DFE for your checkride. Take things slow and be methodical. Don&#39;t rush and Marvin will appreciate the gesture. Plan on 1 1/2 hours for ground work then take to the air. I had extra water and Gatorade for Marvin and we needed it due to the heat. Here&#39;s how the checkride went.<br /> <br /> Marvin showed up early and watched us take the gliders out of the hanger. He saw me take charge and direct the glider movements and insure no damage occurred. Even though this wasn&#39;t part of the checkride he commented on the professionalism of the club members preflighting the gliders (My son Loring used the checklist) and the tow pilot checking the Pawnee. The ASK-21 had a low main wheel and I pumped it up to the correct psi after checking the POH.<br /> <br /> After reviewing the 8710 paperwork, my log book and endorsements, government ID w/ picture, and accepting my $175 check, Marvin officially started the checkride. He follows a checklist to insure no items are left off from the practical. My brain book had tabs separating the material: FAA glider manual, CPL-G practical standards, handouts on navigation flight planning, ASK-21 POH, plus the current weather info and NOTAMs. We used my copy of the CPL-G practical to review the maneuvers and areas required. Section VIII, Navigation is not required for a transition pilot so we didn&#39;t cover it. We never opened a sectional chart nor my new airfield directory.<br /> <br /> Oral Questions<br /> Nothing on aeromedical factors, scanning and collision avoidance, nor principles of flight. He did ask me how we accomplished weight and balance in the B-52....He liked my answer of using antiquated slide rule for moment arm addition/subtraction for an antiquated airplane. We now do it on the computer instead of using the slip stick that is required to be carried on the aircraft. I asked him his weight and showed him the POH table that we are well within the c.g. limit.<br /> <br /> Airspace<br /> He asked me if I knew the airspace....yes down cold was my reply. He asked what&#39;s the biggest area of concern in this area. My answer was the temporary flight restriction (TFR) that went into effect for July 4th weekend and then the ADIZ and Class B airspace. He asked where I got the TFR info. My reply was DUATS and showed him a copy of the NOTAMs and weather from my session. This segued us to weather.<br /> <br /> Weather<br /> What causes the best thermal conditions Atmospheric instability caused by surface heating.<br /> How does the pilot know whether today will produce good thermals I showed him the DUATS TAF and METAR (Dulles and Winchester) plus the RUC Skew-T prediction for FRR that I pulled off the internet that morning. I went over everything I could think of with the Skew-T. Calculated the predicted Thermal Index, where we would run out of lift, and estimated cloud base height. Everything agreed when we actually flew. He asked what other methods were available to a glider pilot. I told him the FAA has a thermal forecast for this region but it was not available Friday morning and it usually only covers the weekend. Mentioned BLIPS.<br /> <br /> What causes all weather patterns He wanted differential sun heating and temperature gradient between the polar and equatorial regions....mucked this answer up, talked around the subject and finally got him to supply the answer he wanted.<br /> <br /> What is the pressure lapse rate....1 in Hg per 1000 feet What is the standard temperature lapse rate...2 degrees C per 1000 feet What is dry adiabatic lapse rate (3 deg C / 1000 ft) and saturated adiabatic lapse rate I pulled out the Skew-T and showed him these lines.<br /> <br /> What are the hazards and how much should a glider avoid a Thunderstorm What characterizes a Thunderstorm Lightening is the biggest hazard and is what characterizes a T-storm.... then microbursts, downdrafts/updrafts, hail. Told him the story of the glider in England that got struck by lightening, and my personal three lightening strikes - two of which were in the blue while flying between T-storms and one at night while in the weather. Avoid by 20 miles.<br /> <br /> What causes wave soaring and how do you fly in wave Drew him a picture of wave conditions, showing lennies, rotor etc. Talked about the necessary conditions of wind direction and increasing wind speed with altitude, plus smooth, stable air to capture the wave. He asked about a foehm cloud<br /> <br /> What conditions characterize ridge soaring Wind perpendicular to the ridge for orographic lift and instable air.<br /> Asked ridge flying scenario questions: How do you pass when ridge soaring When approaching head on who has the right of way Can you thermal when ridge soaring At what altitude would you transition from figure eights to thermalling to gain altitude to go from one ridge to another I said it is situationally dependent...height of ridge, expected sink on the leeward side. Biggest hazard is being blown across the ridge into sink and not having a suitable landing area.<br /> <br /> Asked if I&#39;ve ever landed out...no I&#39;ve only had 37 flights...hmmm was his response. What conditions are you looking for when landing out Another airport. If not available then WWSS...wind, wires, surface, slope. He liked my use of acronyms. What are the preferred surfaces freshly mowed flat field, low stubble fields with minor furrows, fallow hayfield, lastly I would avoid tall cornfields. Why Ground loop and break the glider tail. What is the most important thing to accomplish after landing Stopping the glider as quickly as possible due to the unknown nature of the surface.<br /> <br /> Glider Systems<br /> How does the magnetic compass work Explained it only reads correctly when in straight and level unaccelerated flight. Discussed isogonic lines E vs W variation and correct math. Told him about dip error and UNOS undershoot North overshoot South and ANDS, accelerate North, decelerate South. What&#39;s in the compass My answer of white kerosene is not the correct answer. Tell him it&rsquo;s a highly refined petroleum product with a anti-fungicide additive. He told me this one. I guess he was playing stump the dummy as I was offering up too much information when all he wanted was how does a magnetic compass work. Aligns with the magnetic field of the earth.<br /> <br /> What is the best indication of coordinated flight Yaw string. What sources are used by the airspeed indicator, altimeter, and vario How does the total energy compensator work Thanks George for the simple explanations.<br /> <br /> Oxygen<br /> When is it required What type to use When is a pressure mask required What altitude can you fly with a nose canulla Pretty simple easy questions<br /> <br /> Performance and limitations task<br /> What are the speeds for the ASK-21<br /> Why do high performance gliders add water ballast and what are the problems associated with water ballast Showed him my English (US) units polar curve for the K and how the curve shifts slightly down and to the right with the increase in weight. Problems are increase in weight requires stronger lift and need to dump water before landing.<br /> <br /> Post Oral Stuff<br /> I put together a checklist briefing guide to insure I covered all the pre-flight discussion requirements. We went over transfer of glider control phraseology; emergency egress and use of the seat belts (required by FAR part 91.107 para a(1); plus part 121.571 and 135.117); reviewed my actions during takeoff emergencies and what I expected of him. Reviewing T/O emergencies on the ground allowed me to state during the pre-takeoff checklist, EPs are as briefed, any questions. I think he liked my use of a pre-brief checklist. Standard USAF procedure...<br /> <br /> Preflight<br /> I used the laminated checklist to accomplish the preflight and gave him a running commentary...We accomplished a positive control check of the K. He asked why we must check both directions It may work pushing but not work pulling. How do you know the K control rods are assembled correctly L&#39;Hotellier connections - showed him the diagram in the POH. Asked when it was assembled last. Showed him the log entry.<br /> <br /> What items are required to be in the glider prior to flight AROW plus the FAA N-number waiver letter<br /> <br /> What wears out and requires checking with the Tost release system I said a spring or cam, but wasn&#39;t sure. Answer is the spring. He told me of a club that had a failure of their tost release after two years. Seems they taught everyone to pull the release multiple times to check it both on the ground and in flight and they wore the spring out prematurely. How often must the release be inspected I said only recertified by the factory and pulled every four years out of my brain. Don&#39;t know if this was the correct timeline answer. He didn&rsquo;t say yes or no.<br /> <br /> First Flight<br /> Expected an emergency shortly after passing through 200+ feet but we took a climb to 3000 ft AGL. Passing 700 feet he said to accomplish a box the wax demonstration when I was comfortable. I said passing 1500 feet AGL I&rsquo;ll start the transition through the wake and then the demo.<br /> <br /> Marvin was very specific on maneuvers for me to fly. My head was on a swivel and called out traffic, other gliders and the location of the airport throughout the flight. After boxing the wake and calling out traffic during the demo plus insuring our and the tow plane&rsquo;s flight paths were clear, I got off tow. First maneuver was hold heading at min controllable airspeed then a 360 degree min controllable airspeed, clearing turn using 10-15 degrees of bank. Then he had me turn to a heading of 090. Way too easy, just turned to parallel the runway. He asked me to find some lift; jsut had past through some turning to 090 and went back to the small thermal. I climbed 600 feet back to 3000 AGL, worked the thermal too long and lost another 200 feet before deciding it was time to leave the now dead thermal. Thermaling was my clearing turn. Next maneuver was a steep banked, 720 degree turn. Flew the roll into and out of bank slowing and held 2 g&rsquo;s to slightly under 2 g&rsquo;s during the turn. He said &ldquo;Wow the rear g meter is really accurate.&rdquo; I guess that was a praise. I wasn&rsquo;t looking at the g-meter, just flying using outside references and clearing throughout the maneuver. I did roll out 10 degrees before my original heading so he pimped me to turn 10 more degrees.<br /> <br /> Found more lift and worked it back to 2700 feet AGL, again stayed in it too long. We then did stall recognition, but no stall recovery -- not required for the practical. Went to look for the house thermal, but it wasn&rsquo;t there. We talked about speed to fly in our current sink; what altitude to leave the ridge area and head back to the airport. I think this was a hint so I then decided to go join the Grob over by the ridge who appeared to be in a thermal. They were not, just practicing turns. Quite evident after we joined them and they left immediately and started turns in another direction. (Dick Otis had a first time transition pilot up with him). Prior to joining the Grob he asked what is the thermalling etiquette on joining a glider in a thermal. Afterwards while still searching for a thermal, he asked what I was looking for since the conditions were slightly hazy and no cu was anywhere near us. I said soaring birds, columns of smoke, other gliders. I called out the location of the Grob, the tow plane, plus other traffic throughout the ride. He liked my traffic sighting calls. He asked for a forward slip demo. Did it to zero airspeed. Piet would be proud.<br /> <br /> I decided to call it quitting time and headed back to the pattern with the spoilers full out while accomplishing the checklist. Marvin said be high on final, slip to 200 feet without spoilers, then land normally. Just before calling the entry point a Cessna student pilot called downwind. I announced my position, flew the pattern, making the required calls and announced we would land in the grass since the Cessna was on long final and we were abeam the numbers. Marvin commented that the Cessna wouldn&rsquo;t make the runway if his engine quit. Slip and landing were uneventful.<br /> <br /> Marvin took out a cigarette immediately after the first landing. We waited a while for the tow car to come get us. Finally got back to the FBO, drank some water and took a break for Marvin. It was hot outside. Since there wasn&rsquo;t a crosswind, he asked me about crosswind takeoffs and landings. We BS&rsquo;s some about my B-52 flying and his flying career. After about 30 minutes on the ground I asked Marvin if he was ready (he just lit up another of his many cigarettes). I let him finish then we pushed the K out to the cones and waited for the tow pilot to crank the Pawnee up.<br /> <br /> Second flight<br /> <br /> Second takeoff went smoothly. Shortly after 200 feet he pulled the release...imagine that. I smartly turned the glider around while maintaining 55 knots and said my checklist. He said land abeam the mid field taxi-way and stop within 100 feet of the end, but don&rsquo;t go over. I did a perfect spot landing, rolled out on centerline and stopped 10 feet shy of the end of the runway. I was going to stop much earlier but he said why push the glider more than necessary down the runway to the taxiway.<br /> <br /> That was it. No big surprises. He told Dick Otis I flew an outstanding check. I didn&rsquo;t get that feedback. Dick took a couple of pictures then Marvin and I went to fill out my temporary certificate. He stuck around and watched me take my son up as my first passenger then left.<br /> <br /> It was a fun day, but the checkride took a lot more time than I originally thought. Hope this helps the next person checking with Marvin.<br /> <br /> Best of luck,<br /> George Ross III<br /> July 2004</p>

<p>Checkride Notes </p><p>From: Piet Barber [mailto:<a href="mailto:pbarber@skylinesoaring.org" target="_blank">pbarber@skylinesoaring.org</a>]<br /> Sent: Monday, August 18, 2003 5:38 PM<br /> To: <a href="mailto:dweaver@skylinesoaring.org" target="_blank">dweaver@skylinesoaring.org</a><br /> Subject: Marv-isms Intelligence Report<br /> <br /> Here is my take on the intelligence report from my Commercial Practical:<br /> (Hope this is enough detail for you)<br /> <br /> Oral section:<br /> (Either I was over-prepared, or he went very easy on me.)<br /> <br /> Regs:<br /> What are the privileges of a Commercial Pilots License<br /> What are the restrictions<br /> What kind of maintenance can a pilot do<br /> What does that include<br /> Is a medical certificate required<br /> Why not<br /> How does a pilot determine if he&#39;s OK to fly<br /> Can a pilot fly if he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s OK<br /> Even if he has a medical certificate<br /> <br /> Weather:<br /> What causes instability (that was it for weather systems)<br /> What is the PRESSURE lapse rate<br /> What is the temperature lapse rate<br /> (I can&#39;t believe I couldn&#39;t remember this; but I just drew a blank)<br /> <br /> Aircraft:<br /> We spent a lot of time in the flight manual (more than I was expecting)<br /> <br />  &nbsp;Speeds:<br />  &nbsp;Where in this manual are all of the performance speeds<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We didn&#39;t look at the polars outside of the fact that the min<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sink speed and max L/d speeds aren&#39;t listed per say in the ASK<br /> manual.<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no discussion about speed to fly in sink or lift.<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;there was a very short discussion that the polar was for still air<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;only. Too bad, because I was all prepared to show him the offset<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;origins, and how they are used to compute speed to fly in sink or<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lift, headwind or tailwinds.<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He saw the min-sink speed for the K-21 as 0,67 and was almost very<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;impressed that the sink rate was 66 feet per minute. &nbsp;I pointed<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;out that it was all metric, and pulled out my E-6b, which I had<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;configured beforehand to calculate m/s -&gt; fpm or knots. (This is a<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;really neat tool, IMHO; I&#39;ll show you how I did this sometime.)<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I also converted the kph to knots with the same tool. .67 m/s<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;turns out to be about 132 fpm.<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no discussion about maneuvering speeds, rough air speeds,<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vne, or Vfe; outside of where they were listed in the manual. &nbsp;No<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;discussion about Macready rings either.<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The polar in the flight manual leaves much to be desired, IMHO.<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Somebody should copy that sucker out, put it on graph paper with<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;more tick marks (the only lines on theirs is at 50 kph (well below<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stall speed), 100 kph (above min sink and L/D) and 150 kph. Also<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;an additional chart should be made up with the units that we<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;normally use, instead of their metric equivalents.<br /> <br />  &nbsp;Weight and Balance:<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the sailplane logbook didn&#39;t have any weights in it, the<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;manual didn&#39;t have a record of weights in it, and Fred had the<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;official weight and balance documents at home, I would have had<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;some &#39;splainin to do if the official documents were requested.<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I buffalo&#39;ed in a weasel-like fashion Marv into accepting the<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;chart we have laid out with the old weight and balances. &nbsp;He<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wanted to use the logbook, I used the excuse that the logbook was<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in the plane and that the plane was flying. Those seemed to be<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;good enough. I would rather not have to do this buffaloing again.<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He provided me with a chart of the arms that came off of the<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;aircraft&#39;s type certificate that he got off of the FAA&#39;s website.<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He prepared a weight and balance sheet which had all of the<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;appropriate numbers filled in from the Type certificate sheet, and<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I filled in the empty weight and the empty-weight&#39;s arm.<br /> <br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had a spreadsheet calculated ahead of time with mine and his<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;weights pre-computed to see if I got a correct answer. &nbsp;The end of<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the sheet had two yes/no questions: were the weights under gross,<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and was the CG within tolerable limits<br /> <br />  &nbsp;Oxygen Systems:<br />  &nbsp;What altitude is oxygen required<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No discussion about oxygen systems in particular, or the<br />  &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trick question: the way he reads the regs, it doesn&#39;t appear that<br /> there are any restrictions for setting the altimeter to an aircraft so<br /> long as it&#39;s not using cruising altitudes. &nbsp;I haven&#39;t looked at the regs to<br /> form my own opinion on the issue. &nbsp;Apparently, he&#39;s found a little bit of<br /> grey area in the regs. &nbsp;The section that talks about altimeter settings<br /> describes it &quot;for use in cruising altitudes&quot; which gliders don&#39;t really<br /> use. &nbsp;I just shrugged and went along with it.<br /> <br /> Aircraft rigging/de-rigging:<br />  &nbsp;Have you ever assembled a sailplane<br />  &nbsp;What would you do if we were to assemble a sailplane<br />  &nbsp;What is the most important thing to do after assembly (thorough<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pre-flight including positive control check)<br />  &nbsp;Ever landed out<br /> <br /> Launch procedures:<br />  &nbsp;No mention of ground tows or motorgliders<br />  &nbsp;No mention of procedures; except when we were in the air, he quizzed me<br /> on all of the airborne signals.<br /> <br /> Pre-flight preparation:<br />  &nbsp;A cross country course from FRR to Eagles Nest.<br />  &nbsp;I used a transparency sheet overlaid over the sectional, using the 4000&#39;<br /> rings from the sheet that Joe Parrish made out a few years ago. &nbsp;Since the<br /> forecast had 4000&#39; max lift in weak thermals, I judged the go-no-go points<br /> based on that altitude. &nbsp;I circled FRR, Lurray, SHO, and Eagles&#39; nest to<br /> show which fields I would land in if within the appropriate range. &nbsp;The<br /> circle was about 6 NM around each field. &nbsp;I used the trusty E6b to<br /> calculate wind correction (not much) from predicted wind directions at<br /> that time of day (which turned out to be off by 120 degrees)<br /> <br /> Aircraft pre-flight:<br /> <br />  &nbsp;There was rain on the wing, it had been drizzling:<br />  &nbsp;&quot;How much does the rain effect the lift on the wing&quot;<br />  &nbsp;&quot;Not much on a 126 or 2-33, but significant on the high performance<br /> gliders; This one somewhere in between&quot;<br /> <br />  &nbsp;For the pre-flight:<br />  &nbsp;I used the aircraft flight manual, and found it particularly crummy for<br /> the job. &nbsp;What should be used instead is a written checklist that doesn&#39;t<br /> have somebody jumping from point to point. &nbsp;The checklist in the manual<br /> (section VII.2) is crummy because it has the pilot go into the cockpit.<br /> Go to both wings, go back into the cockpit, check only a few of the<br /> aircraft systems in it. &nbsp;There was no walk around the aircraft in a<br /> circle concept in that section of the manual. &nbsp; I felt a little unprepared<br /> for just how bad the aircraft&#39;s manual was in this regard. I felt silly<br /> going back and forth, in and out; I felt like I was doing this the first<br /> time. &nbsp;Bleck.<br /> <br /> The aircraft manual contains vague descriptions of checking the controls,<br /> NO discussion about checking the instruments, no description about<br /> checking the harnesses/seat-belts, no description of going into the<br /> maintenance panel to inspect control linkages. &nbsp;Somebody should go and<br /> make an exhaustive preflight inspection checklist for that aircraft. &nbsp;The<br /> PTS says to use a written checklist, that&#39;s all I had, and I was<br /> disappointed. I should have had a written checklist ahead of time.<br /> <br /> We did a positive control check including the spoilers which he tried to<br /> skip over (don&#39;t know if it was on purpose or not)<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Flight portion: Flight 1:<br />  &nbsp;&quot;This is your aircraft!&quot; &quot;You&#39;re the pilot in command!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m just the<br /> passenger!&quot;<br /> <br />  &nbsp;The take-off checklist, I used the written checklist, the green sheet<br /> that is in the baggage compartment in the ASK-21. &nbsp;It&#39;s very handy. &nbsp;I<br /> made sure to show this to Marv before we got into the aircraft. &nbsp;I also<br /> pointed out that the diagram has runways 27 and runway &quot;6&quot;. &nbsp;I had my own<br /> printed up for take off and landing, including the &quot;T&quot; in Tail dolly.<br /> That was in the hangar, and we were down on Runway 9 by now. &nbsp;Oh well.<br /> <br />  &nbsp;Marv got seated first, while we were lined up on the runway, I felt a<br /> bit rushed with the straps portion, and my briefing on the straps felt<br /> rushed, but I got out all of the required straps commands out, &quot;Straps<br /> tight Here&#39;s how you get of them. &nbsp;I am telling you that you have to keep<br /> them on through the whole flight&quot;<br /> <br />  &nbsp;When we were saddling up, He watched the tail dolly get taken off, and<br /> didn&#39;t get into the cockpit until the tail dolly was off. &nbsp;I added a &quot;T&quot;<br /> to the written checklist to ensure that the tail dolly was off (SIFT has<br /> two T&#39;s as far as I&#39;m concerned; I&#39;ll never forget the tail dolly again).<br /> <br />  &nbsp;We took off, the towplane basically flew directly into the wind, which<br /> was coming from about 060. &nbsp;This would have made a 200&#39; rope break require<br /> me to turn to the right, which would have been a very uncomfortable turn<br /> away from the wind. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad Marv didn&#39;t pull the rope at that point.<br /> The climb didn&#39;t have us reach 200&#39; until well after the power lines, and<br /> after &nbsp;the towplane turned right.<br /> <br />  &nbsp;When we were headed downwind, Marv directed, &quot;When you get to an<br /> altitude that you&#39;re comfortable with, Box the wake&quot;<br /> <br />  &nbsp;We didn&#39;t get to that altitude until we were at about 1700 feet. This<br /> was because our course on tow had us heading toward the mountains, and we<br /> didn&#39;t turn away from the mountains until we were about 1500 feet from the<br /> top of the massanutten ridge, same altitude. &nbsp; Marv was really in no rush,<br /> but I wanted to get it over with.<br /> <br /> The towplane paused briefly on a northerly heading. I took advantage of<br /> the course that was not headed toward the mountains, and I began the<br /> maneuver, headed down through the wake. &nbsp;About halfway through the wake,<br /> the towplane turned right. &nbsp;I rolled right while in the wake, and I kept<br /> position in low tow, with the same bank angle as the towplane until he<br /> established a heading easterly, which he maintained for the rest of the<br /> duration of the aerotow.<br /> <br />  &nbsp;I went through all of the positions of boxing the wake, we didn&#39;t feel<br /> any turbulence except for a very slight rumble lasting about 2 seconds, in<br /> the lower left position. I guess I wasn&#39;t left-enough. I corrected for it,<br /> and Marv didn&#39;t breathe a word. &nbsp;I paused at each corner and counted aloud<br /> &quot;one, two, three&quot;<br />  &nbsp;Lower left, upper left, pause behind towplane, upper right, lower right,<br /> move directly to lower left without pause at the center, upper left, back<br /> to center.<br />  &nbsp;I used about 10-15 degrees of bank to stop the movement from upper left<br /> to center, he didn&#39;t seem to mind. &nbsp;(I didn&#39;t use all rudders for these<br /> maneuvers, like the SFM says you should use).<br /> <br />  &nbsp;We had a very normal release, &nbsp;About 200 feet before release altitude, I<br /> looked right I shouted out that I didn&#39;t see any traffic. At 3700 MSL, I<br /> pulled the release and &nbsp;I confirmed out loud that I saw the rope fall<br /> away. &nbsp;I rolled 90 degrees right to an easterly heading.<br /> <br />  &nbsp;After release, we were positioned to east of the field heading east:<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;What speed does this aircraft stall at:&quot;<br />  &nbsp;P: &quot;The slowest we can get is around 38, at 37 or 36 we&#39;ll stall&quot;<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;Do a 180 turn to the left&quot;<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;Do a 180 degree turn to the right&quot;<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;OK, go into slow flight&quot;<br />  &nbsp;P: &quot;OK, I&#39;m going to be doing a couple of clearing turns first, I&#39;ll do<br /> a 90 and a 90&quot;<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;You mean you weren&#39;t looking for traffic when we did those two<br /> turns&quot;<br />  &nbsp;P: (on the inside: damned if I do, damned if I don&#39;t)<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; (on the inside: It&#39;s a question similar to &quot;So when did you stop<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;beating your wife&quot;)<br />  &nbsp;P: I was looking for traffic to make sure I wouldn&#39;t bump into it, but<br /> wasn&#39;t looking down.<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;Oh OK.&quot;<br />  &nbsp;(turns complete)<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;Bring it back to 38 knots&quot;<br />  &nbsp;P: &quot;No burble yet, but we&#39;re really close&quot;<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;Come back some more&quot;<br />  &nbsp;(burble begins)<br />  &nbsp;P: &quot;any more and we&#39;re going to stall&quot;<br />  &nbsp;M: recover. &nbsp;Increase to 42 knots<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;Do a 360 degree turn to the left&quot; (no bank designation)<br />  &nbsp;M: &quot;Do a 360 degree turn to the right&quot; (no bank designation, I chose 30<br /> again)<br />  &nbsp;M: Do a 90 degree turn to the left: (now heading north)<br />  &nbsp;M: increase to L/D speed<br />  &nbsp;M: Turn to 270<br />  &nbsp;(I don&#39;t know WTF I was thinking, and did a 360+90 turn to the left)<br />  &nbsp;(Oh well, we ended up at 270. )<br />  &nbsp;M: Keep course of 270. &nbsp;We kept this course till we got to the southeast<br /> of the field<br />  &nbsp;M: steep turn to the left, 720 degrees<br />  &nbsp;M: steep turn to the right, 720 degrees (I kept speed to within a knot<br /> both times)<br />  &nbsp;M: Where would you find lift<br />  &nbsp;P: &quot;Usually over those houses over there&quot;<br />  &nbsp;M: find some lift if you can, land when you&#39;re ready, use as little<br /> runway as possible.<br /> <br /> No lift was found at all.<br /> <br /> I did as standard a pattern and landing as I could. &nbsp;I made radio calls<br /> for every turn I made (including final) &nbsp;Approach speed was 52-53 knots<br /> through the whole pattern. I didn&#39;t go below 52 and didn&#39;t&#39; go above 55.<br /> <br /> On final, my aim point was 10 feet in front of the numbers. The no-flare<br /> glide path impact point did not move more than 1 foot during final<br /> approach. I touched down just past the numbers, where I said I would, and<br /> stopped just after the taxiway, before the third stripe ended, just like I<br /> said I would. I don&#39;t know what speed I touched down at, but if I had to<br /> guess, it was probably around 48 or so. (this was about the best landing<br /> I&#39;ve ever done. :) &nbsp;)<br /> <br /> I noticed that Marv took a long time to get out of the glider.<br /> <br /> The Grob took off after we landed. We had time to get some more water in<br /> me. Marv had another Marlboro light.<br /> <br /> Between the flights, Marv asked me where I would land if we were just over<br /> the power lines. I said we would be in big trouble if we were lower than<br /> 150 feet (we could probably make it back in 150 feet, but I wouldn&#39;t want<br /> to do it), that there are very slim pickings for fields off the end of<br /> runway 27. &nbsp;He asked what we would do if the rope break happened at 800<br /> feet. &nbsp;I responded that if we were in lift, work it. Otherwise, set up for<br /> as normal a pattern and landing as we could.<br /> <br /> Flight #2, when we took off, the Grob was at about 1500, lingering around<br /> the IP. &nbsp;I indicated to the tow-pilot that we would go to &quot;two&quot;. Marv<br /> indicated that we were going to &quot;play it by ear&quot;.<br /> <br /> Normal take off, we were airborne by the midfield taxiway.<br /> <br /> 200&#39; was well after the power lines.<br /> <br /> We turned west at 250&#39;. &nbsp;At around 400 - 450 feet, Marv pulled the<br /> release. &nbsp;It surprised me, but it should not have. This was probably the<br /> first time since I was a student that a release sound actually made me<br /> jump. The Grob was at about 1200 feet over the IP. &nbsp;The Towplane and<br /> glider were chatting on UNICOM, so I couldn&#39;t make my radio calls without<br /> stomping on their transmissions.<br /> <br /> M: &quot;Land wherever you want, but on final, I want a slip to landing without<br /> the use of spoilers&quot;<br /> <br /> 1100 feet indicated on the altimeter as we crossed the numbers on<br /> downwind. I wasn&#39;t quite ready for the compounded issues of rope break<br /> plus no spoilers, so I wasn&#39;t as clear headed as I should have been.<br /> I probably turned downwind to base too early; we were way higher than I<br /> normally would be at that point, because of the use of no spoilers.<br /> <br /> If I had to do it again, I would have used a forward slip on downwind, on<br /> base and on final, to make up for that 1/2 spoilers that I usually use<br /> during those stages of the pattern. I started a slip, left wing down as<br /> soon as we turned on final. Speed was about 55 knots (too high) as I<br /> initiated the slip. &nbsp;We started moving out of position &nbsp;away from the<br /> centerline. &nbsp; Over the numbers, we must have been about 150 feet: I also<br /> wanted to land long, because I knew that the Grob would be right behind me<br /> and that Marv takes forever to get out of the glider.<br /> <br /> Full forward slip, and the airspeed indicator dropped to zero. About 75<br /> feet over the midfield taxiway, and we were finally lined up with the<br /> centerline. &nbsp;The bank must have been about 40 degrees.<br /> <br /> &quot;Pull spoilers any time you want&quot;<br /> <br /> Immediately. &nbsp;We were already coming down like a brick, but the spoilers<br /> just helped out. We were on the pavement and would have stopped well short<br /> of the end of the runway, but I eased up on the brakes and rolled all the<br /> way to the end of the runway. &nbsp;I kind of winced in embarrassment, as this<br /> was way further down the runway than I would have ever wanted, but at<br /> least we were well away from the Grob, landing behind us.<br /> <br /> After stopping, I jumped out, and told Marv to stay in the cockpit. &nbsp;I<br /> picked up the left wing, put the right wing on the ground, pulled on the<br /> nose of the glider, and pulled the glider off of the runway. &nbsp;By this<br /> time, the Grob had landed, and Marv was still in the back seat. &nbsp;We<br /> cleared the hold lines by the time the Grob had touched down. The tow car<br /> greeted us, and Marv said &quot;We&#39;re all done! You can put this back in the<br /> hangar if you want&quot;.<br /> <br /> Marv waited in the FBO while I took the glider all the way back down to<br /> Rwy 09. &nbsp;He lit up another Marlboro Light. &nbsp;That makes about 6.<br /> <br /> When I made it back, we filled out all the paperwork for my temporary<br /> certificate. &nbsp;We had to make a change to the 8070-1 form, I had to add &quot;DO<br /> NOT USE&quot; in the SSN portion of the application, as I didn&#39;t want my SSN on<br /> my pilots certificate.</p>

<p>Checkride Notes:</p><p>I sent this to Bob Sallada and he mentioned that you keep some sort of list of these and might be interested in my report. So, here you are:</p><p>    General impression is that it was a fair bit easier than I thought it would be, particularly the oral. I knew he didn&#39;t necessarily have to cover everything in detail but I was surprised at how fast he went through some things. The flight portions were even easier than your cake-walk prep flights from a few weeks past.</p><p>    Random bits you might find interesting:</p><p>    You may recall we had a bit of discussion during those prep flights as to whether it was &quot;cheating&quot; to look at the runway during a turn to a heading. In fact, he had me do just two of them, both of them in clear view of the airport. What&#39;s more, my compass was completely jammed the whole time. (Yes, I told him about it.)</p><p>    On the last flight, I just about ran out of elevator authority. We were cruising at about 50kts and I had the stick a fraction of an inch from the aft stop. I was reminded of George&#39;s discussion of having the tape come loose and creating a dam. I used his solution (trim forward) to good effect. On the ground, I checked the tape but nothing was wrong there. We finally concluded that the rain on the elevator had decreased its effectiveness just like it does for the wings. In any case, not a major problem, but it was a bit disconcerting for a while.</p><p>    The slip to landing procedure was a bit different from anything I&#39;d ever done before. He had me keep the spoilers closed all the way through an extended downwind and base, then had me do a slip with no spoilers for the first part of final. When we got too high, I asked if I could use the spoilers, he said ok, and we landed normally. This is as described in the PTS but I have a hard time seeing what practical purpose it serves. It seems to me that testing a slip to landing with spoilers out would make a lot more sense. Maybe I&#39;m just expecting too much of the FAA.</p><p>    The distraction which everybody was preparing me for never materialized. When I asked him about it, he said he might have tried a couple of times but I was so much PIC that he never got anywhere with it. I had no reservations about cutting off his maneuvers when I wanted to come back in, so I guess he just didn&#39;t get much of a chance to do anything like that. I think I&#39;ve told you this before, but I think you really did a great job in teaching me the PIC spirit even when I was pre-solo.</p><p>    A new twist on the rope break; the tow pilot almost always lets the tow plane drift in the wind so that you&#39;re nicely set up to turn into the wind when the time comes. But this time he turned fairly strongly upwind, making me turn downwind and overshoot the runway centerline by a large amount. No problem though, I brought it back to center like I needed to and got it on the ground.</p><p>    I only managed half of a box before we started bumping up against cloudbase and released. He didn&#39;t seem to mind, and didn&#39;t ask for the other half.</p><p>    There were a lot of questions about landing out. He had me picking fields a lot during the last flight (maybe this was his try at a distraction) and he quizzed me on the ground afterwards about what I&#39;m looking for in a field and such. I&#39;m a little weak in this area but I managed to answer everything. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s just looking for general theoretical knowledge in the area. He told me that he&#39;s never landed out, which is kind of surprising. Maybe he&#39;s just that good....</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Have the 8710 form completed and electronically submitted. Also, make sure all of the required endorsements are in your logbook. Marvin will check to see that they are all there. Bob Sallada did a great job of making sure all the endorsements were there, especially the aerotow endorsement. He basically goes through FAA-S-8081-22, Private Pilot Practical Test Standards for Glider, April 1999, specifically the Applicant&rsquo;s Practical Test Checklist. He will ask you a question of two about each line item in the checklist and check it off as he feels you have a good understanding of the subject matter. He will ask you were you got your weather report for the day and he wants to here that you have signed up for DUATS and received the report from them. Call 1-800-WX-BRIEF to subscribe, it is free of charge if you are a pilot or student pilot. The website weather briefings are acceptable to have as backup information. Have the maintenance log for the aircraft you will be using for your practical. Know were the annual inspection is recorded and the current measurement of weight and CG. Marvin weights 180 lbs, so do the weight and CG calculations using the measured glider weight and CG in the maintenance log. Have the operations manual for the aircraft you will be using for the practical. Know your speeds-to-fly, operating limits, and what maintenance you as a pilot are allowed to perform. Know you&rsquo;re sectional. Marvin will have you lay out a sectional and randomly ask questions about what thing mean. No problem using the legend and know the areas pilots should not enter. Marvin will ask you to plot a course and will give you the course he would like plotted one or two days prior to the practical. Both Mike Ash and I were asked to plot a course from FRR toPetersburg,&nbsp;WV. I would recommend you have both a&nbsp;Washington&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cincinnatisectional. Make notice of the two observation towers near&nbsp;Petersburg&nbsp;as reference points. They are very hard to see on the sectional. I used both the graphical method outlined in the Glider Flying Handbook and the EB6 computer for obtaining corrected course direction. Know the minimum elevations you need to safety return to FRR or go all the way to W99. Know the configuration, evaluation, and instrumentation regulations for all the airspace classes. Know how to apply load factors. Know what all the marking are at FRR, what the yellow line mean, what the white line mean, what the lights at the ends and sides of the runway mean, etc.</span></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Flight Examination:</span></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Marvin will ask you to assume that he has never been in a glider before so make sure you orient him to the cockpit, show him how to latch the canopy and safety belts, and tell him what things not to touch. Marvin will tell you right up front that if he has to take command of the glider due to a safety concern that could be grounds for failure of the practical. Make sure you always clear the area before any turn and/or stall. With me, Marvin concentrated a lot on slow flying. Turns and straight flying just below the stall speed of the glider. Set your yaw string on the horizon and keep it there during your turns. Know the six things leading to a stall, stick all the way back, loss of airspeed and horizon, buffet, etc. If you feel a thermal, don&rsquo;t be afraid to work it. Marvin noted in my debriefing that I did not recognize thermals. Problem was, I was waiting for his direction to perform a maneuver and did not think to work the thermals. My mistake! What he would prefer is to fly the thermals in order to stay in the air as long as possible, especially for the first flight, so you can demonstrate coordinated turns, stalls, slow flying, banked turns, etc. He will have you demonstrate high and low tow positions and box the wake on the first flight. He did not introduce a lot of distractions on my first flight, but expect it on the second and/or third. My first flight lasted about 50 minutes and we basically were able to go through all the flying maneuvers in that flight. During the landing, he took my way east of the airport and then directed me to do a 180 degree turn and slip to a landing. Only problem was that we were way too high when he asked me to turn so I ended up demonstrating a slip parallel to 29 at about 1,000&rsquo; AGL and then making a normal landing on the second pass. The second flight I was expecting some sort of emergency procedure, rope break, wave off, etc. He asked me several time what I would do if the rope broke here or if the tow plane wagged his tail or dipped his wings. He did not make me demonstrate an emergency procedure. His main emphasis on the second flight was distraction. He had me fly out by Signal Knob and Interstate 81 and then started asking me where I might land if we could not get back to FRR. All the time we were in heavy sink and about 5 miles from FRR. His goal here was distract me enough that I did not recognize that we were low on altitude and needed to take action to safety get back to the airport. He asked questions about what to look for in a good landing spot, what do the presence of cows mean, how would you checkout the landing spot prior to landing, etc. I put the nose down to obtain the best L/D and headed for the airport and tried to answer some of his questions. We arrived at the entry point at about 1,400&rsquo; indicated and were able to make a normal landing. &nbsp;After the second flight we were done.</span></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">General comment:</span></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span></font></p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Marvin does not expect you to know everything in the oral examination or be at instructor level for flying capability.

I didn&rsquo;t have much of an answer and Marvin said he wanted to show the instructors that they needed to be teaching assembly/disassembly. He looked up in the FAR the items that you must have knowledge of and of course assembly/disassembly was one of them. I believe Marvin thinks it should be added to the syllabus.

<p>Marvin started with the paperwork:  driver's license, previous pilot certificate, check for $225 (includes $50 travel) and informed me he would be going by the PTS (specific items for glider add-on to airplane private).  I stumbled through the first couple of questions about weather (my weakest subject - why isn't " I go up and if the vario beeps, I turn" a good answer?).  Explanations of ridge lift, wave, unstable air (hot air below, cool air above).  (Didn't ask about coastal convergence - damn!)  Where do you get weather? (DUATS or 1 800 WX BRIEF).  Aircraft systems:  how does the airspeed indicator work? (Difference between ram air pressure in the pitot tube and static pressure.)  What avionics do you have in the glider?  (Radio and the vario that is audible.)  What is the pressure lapse rate?  (One inch of mercury per 1000 feet of altitude - not any of the temperature lapse rates I attempted to rattle off - Marvin just smiled at me and repeated the question.)  What is the breaking strength of the towrope (we had gone outside and he was looking at the reels in the trailer)?  Marvin did not like my answer of 500 pounds (for the skinny ropes that we use for the Sprite and some private ships) but he let it ride.  I had the ASK-21 flight manual at the table (nice clean copy in the white binder).  He accepted the CG calculation I had done the night before (took awhile to find the actual loaded CG range in the manual - don't be fooled by the empty CG for main wheel and nose wheel).  I showed him min. sink and max L/D on the polar.  I don't know, maybe Marvin was feeling feeble - I didn't feel like we really did everything in the PTS, but wasn't going to argue.</p>

<p>I went through the pre-flight inspection and passenger briefing, put Marvin in his seat belts.  I guess I did too good a job briefing emergency procedures, 'cause he pulled the tow release on me at precisely 200 feet on the first tow.  On the full tow, we did steep turns, stalls and he had me set up high on an extended final to do a slip.  He just wanted to see me maintain a ground track to the runway.  On the third tow, he made a half-hearted attempt to distract me and get me to continue downwind, but agreed quickly when I asked if I could do the maneuver upwind.  I realized I had not done the pre-landing checklist out loud before so made a big production of it this time.  On "look and land", I saw the tow plane and glider still on the runway, so declared a landing in the grass.  The tug and tow probably cleared the runway in time for me to land, but I stuck with my declared plan and burned a stripe in the grass for a relatively short landing, which may have pleased Marvin.</p>

<p>I cannot emphasize enough the value of a rigorous single instructor-driven preparation for the oral and practical exam IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EXAM SO THINGS ARE FRESH IN YOUR MIND AND MUSCLES.</p>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Dick
Otis reported that there was some wind blowing aloft and a little
turbulence. Piet had assembled JS and was prepared to fly so to get a
feel for the winds aloft near the ground I asked Piet to launch
first. This initial take off was aborted due to the rope not being
secured to the release correctly. His second take off attempt was
normal so I determined that I would commence with the flight portion
of the test. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Before
taking off I performed a pre-flight inspection of the ASK-21.
Describing each inspection item as I went along. I also pointed out
the assembly items as part of the inspection. He made no comment as I
did the inspection. I did a passenger briefing describing the glider
controls, instruments, and radios. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">When
the tow plane returned we pushed the glider out for launch with
standard SSC procedures. I did a passenger brief verifying that he
was belted in correctly and the canopy was closed and locked. I got
in and belted. I was informed that Dick couldn't hear me on the radio
despite hearing the transmission  from the speakers at the FBO. A
hand held was provided and I turned off the glider radio and ued the
handheld for communications. I did a normal takeoff there was a
little turbulence.I narrated my procedures for rope break as we
climbed. Marvin requested I perform a boxing the wake. I asked if the
SSC high low transition was appropriate. After informing Dick I would
box the wake I started the transition. When I got to the top of the
box after moving to the the right side Dick turned left and descended
causing the rope to go a little slack. I kept the glider pointed
straight ahead and descended as the slack came out with minimal
acceleration. Marvin said that I could return to normal tow as we
were at release altitude and the boxing and slack line recovery were
acceptable. I stabilized the tow position and cleared the area around
the glider. Pulled the release, verified that the rope was slack then
turned 90 degrees right narrating as I flew. I did steep turns 720
degreed both ways then a clean stall and turning stall. I stared with
a descent to gt a higher deceleration rate. Marvin accepted the
technique but told me that a landing style descending deceleration is
acceptable even though you don't get a clean break just a burble. I
called out altitudes after each maneuver. I then did slow flight with
a 360 degree turn to the left. Marvin asked me to do a turn to the
right and I was down to 2,200ft msl and at the ip so I notified
Marvin that I was going to land. We hit 7 kts up at the ip and Marvin
said "Take it", so I rode the thermal up to 3,500 ft. Marvin asked to take the
controls. We did the verbal and physical exchange of cotrols. He did
3 turns and I suggested that this was my check ride so I would prefer
to fly. We exchanged controls back.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The
Grob and Pawnee were towing as I ok the controls back I could see the
Pawnee turing to 45 as I called 45 so I started working the ip
thermal again. I stayed in until the Pawnee landed and I was up to
5,000 ft. I asked about showing more check of items and Marvin
pointed out that by thermalling after the Pawnee called 45 I shoed
good judgement and while I was turing and centering the thermal I did
slow flight, best sink rate, speed to fly when I fell out of the
lift, found three thermals and steep turns while optimizing m climb.
He said I could head back or thermal for a while so I rode lift for
an hour flight and then when it came time to come down I flew to the
sink and flew around in the sink at 70kts use up altitude. Marvin
asked me to do a slip to landing so I started slipping on 45 all the
way to the 20 feet off ground because of the ip thermal. I used
spoilers to pin the glider then rolled to about 50ft of the hanger
taxiway. Marvin said I only needed one more flight to complete the
exam.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">We
towed the glider back to to the approach end of the runway and hooked
up for a tow. I called out the rope break procedures at 50 feet
increments. At 200 feet we were still over the departure end of the
runway so I delayed about 3 seconds before I turned. I deployed the
spoilers full as I turned Marvin said to land as close to the hangars
as I could I touched down at the hangar taxiway so I closed the
spoilers and rolled back to the approach end of the runway. We pushed
off to allow the Pawnee to land and hooked back up. Marvin said the
test is over but asked me to do a pattern tow and stop as close to
the hangars as I could. We hooked up and started a normal tow and at
400 feet Marvin asked what I would do if the rope broke. I pointed
out that the airport was just behind us and I would do a normal
pattern. I released at 2,700ft and did a normal pattern and landing
stopping at the middle of the taxiway  in front of the hangars.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The
training I received in the end was very complete and safe. I spent
too much time during the summer thermalling when I should have been
working on basic flying skills. If I did it like the check ride and
combined thermalling with check ride skills my flying skills would
have returned faster. Despite being a add on rating I hadn't flown
for about 2.5 years so my flying skills were rusty.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">It
makes sense to fly with the same instructor initially for both new
students and add on ratings. Switching instructors all the time
requires the instructor and the student coming up to speed with each
other despite the efficient training records online.  This is mostly
a perception problem with the student since there isn't a financial
penalty for more flights with an instructor. By the time a student
solo's they are pretty close to being ready to take the check ride. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">With
all the waiting during training it would make sense for students to
study with each other while they wait for their next flight. </FONT>
