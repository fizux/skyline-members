<h1>Log Sheets</h1>

<p>This directory includes the executable you'll need for the logsheet program, and an interface to search previously-submitted logsheets. Usually the two links you'll be using the most are:  </P>
<ol><li><b>DOWNLOAD</b> -- Download the latest logsheet program. This will have the latest information about members, temporary members, and will include the logsheets of the last 20 days of operations. </li>
<li><b>UPLOAD</b> -- Upload the logsheet of a day's operations.  The program allows multiple uploading of a logsheet for a single day. 
</ol>
<p>There are two versions of the <b>ssclog</b> program, one for Windows and one for the MAC.  Both programs are compressed as zip files. </p>
<p>Linux users can use the windows ssclog program under <a href ="http://www.winehq.org">WINE</a>, it's been tested pretty thoroughly and seems to work just fine.
